# EcoMeter: A True CO2 Predictor ðŸŒ±

## Overview
EcoMeter is an innovative platform designed to predict CO2 emissions accurately. This application combines a React frontend with a powerful Python backend to provide reliable carbon footprint predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.x
- VS Code (recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/binitworld/EcoMeter.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd EcoMeter
   ```

3. **Open in VS Code**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

4. **Setup Front-end (Terminal 1)**

   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Setup Back-end (Terminal 2)**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   ```
   The backend server will start and API endpoints will be accessible

## Usage Guide

1. Once both servers are running, open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL
2. Click on "Start Simulator" to access the Prediction page
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to initiate the prediction process
4. Input required parameters to get CO2 predictions



## Important Notes
- Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running simultaneously
- Keep both terminals active during development
- Check console for any error messages or logs
